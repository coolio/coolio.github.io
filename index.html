  Do you like Sinatra? Do you like Node.js? Wish you could write Node.js apps in Ruby as easily as you write Sinatra apps. Let's ask Cool.io how.

    <span class="coolio-blurb">See? Look at that, it's easy! But how's it work? Let's take a peek into the parts of my DSL:</span>
</p>
<p>
    <ul class="code-bullets">
        <li>
            <span class="code">cool.io.connection</span> -
            Create a new connection class. Give your connection a name, then use the block to define callbacks 
            for various events.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <span class="code">on_connect</span>, <span class="code">on_close</span>, <span class="code">on_read</span> -
            These are callbacks fired when events occur, specifically when we get a new connection to our echo
            server, when a connection closes, and when data is read from the network.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <span class="code">cool.io.server</span> -
            This creates a new server that listens on the given host and port. When someone connects to our server,
            a new connection of the given type will be created. In the case of our echo server, we'll create new
            :echo_server_connections.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <span class="code">cool.io.attach</span> -
            This attaches the newly created server to the default cool.io event loop. This means the event loop will
            listen for events from the server. There's also <span class="code">cool.io.detach</span> which will stop
            the event loop from monitoring events from our server.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <span class="code">cool.io.run</span> -
            This runs the default cool.io event loop. The event loop will block, waiting for events. In the case of our
            echo server, it will wait for incoming connections, and once it's received them, it will wait for the client
            to send data, the echo it back to the client.
        </li> 
    </ul>
